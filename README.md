# Weather-Dashboard

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

1. WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

2. WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

3. WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

4. WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

5. WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

Here is a mockup of what is should look like:
